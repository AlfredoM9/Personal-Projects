# Description
Currently leading a team of 5 into the Agile process of creating a social media type app for student organizations on campuses. The app will include a great deal of options for students to explore and organizers to be prepared. So far, I have created a “Create Event” page for organizers. This page will accumulate any necessary information and store it in the database (Firebase). The page functions like any other form with input validation, error messages, and when completed shows a completion message and redirects it to the home page. My next task is to create a page for users to be able to visually see the event information. This will include retrieving information from the database.
