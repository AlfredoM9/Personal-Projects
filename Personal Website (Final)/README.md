# Description
Modified existing code from a template provided by Rashmi Ap. The design and UI remained the same. The only modification done to this website is in the “About Page”. The three cards at the bottom previously redirected the user to one of the pages on top menu. However, that was changed to have a pop-up window instead to demonstrate either my basic info, skills, and interests. In addition, the skills pop up has a star rating with each skill and when the window is too small the star rating disappears. Future plans are to add a filter option to the projects in order to filter by language, date, etc.
