# Description
Currently working on a console based personal assistant to help me record my workouts, my goals, and give me daily briefings of what I should do that current day. The program will respond to specific input which has been predefined and limited to very few actions and perform the necessary functions corresponding to that action requested. So far, I am working on storing the information of the user locally so whenever a user tries to run the program again it will have the information of the user and a daily motivational message should appear with the menu of actions.
