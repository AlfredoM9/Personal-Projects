# Description
Briefly developed a page for the SHPE at UTD website using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JS. The page was intended for members to be able to pay their dues. The page was created using HTML, CSS, and JS, and PHP was then used to connect the page to the server. In addition, I created manually SQL tables in the database for further expansion of our database schema. The page that I worked on was never merged to the main branch as the goals deviated from what the project manager wanted.
