# Description
Developed a react app from scratch as my personal website. The website has a top menu navigation and a side bar menu (if the window is too small) and dynamically displayed data about me. However due to the styling of the website I changed the website for a professional website. In addition, a previous attempt to creating a personal website was done in simple HTML, CSS, and JS but the felt the website was too clustered.

### Note
Previous Attempt 1: HTML, CSS, JS
Previous Attempt 2: React
