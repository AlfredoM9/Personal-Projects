NBA All-Star Game 2020 - Relive the wild finish to Team LeBron's win
<p>LeBron James shares his thoughts on the new format of the NBA All-Star Game and on what honoring Kobe Bryant meant to everyone. (1:57)</p>
<p>NBA All-Star Weekend is a wrap -- but not before a thrilling fourth quarter between Team LeBron and Team Giannis <a href="/nba/story/_/id/28720402/the-elam-ending-led-intense-all-star-fourth-quarter" target="_blank">sent the NBA world into a frenzy</a>.</p>
<p>Lock-down defense was played. Fouls were argued. We even had a coach's challenge!</p>
<p>In the end, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6583/anthony-davis">Anthony Davis</a> knocked down a tension-filled free throw to secure the win, and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6450/kawhi-leonard">Kawhi Leonard</a> took home the <a href="/nba/story/_/id/28720292/kawhi-leonard-scores-30-goes-8-14-3-pointers-win-mvp" target="_blank">first Kobe Bryant All-Star MVP Award</a>.</p>
<p>Relive every big moment from an action-packed weekend in Chicago, which culminated in Team LeBron's <a href="/nba/game?gameId=401197813">157-155 win</a> over Team Giannis.</p>

<p>Apart from the <a href="/nba/story/_/id/28600471/nba-changes-all-star-game-format-adds-kobe-bryant-tribute" target="_blank">revamped format for this season</a> -- the first three quarters served as "mini games" in which each win secured money for charity -- the first 36 minutes of the All-Star Game went as expected. Alley-oops came more easily than layups, 3-pointers were falling from everywhere, and defense was very much optional.</p>
<p>Then the fourth quarter happened, and an all-time classic broke out.</p>
<p>The Elam Ending and first-to-157 finish turned the usual All-Star format on its head. Players were diving for loose balls, running plays, swarming on defense and, in the case of Team Giannis' <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3012/kyle-lowry">Kyle Lowry</a>, <a href="/video/clip?id=28720008" target="_blank">taking charges</a>.</p>
<p>Before the All-Star Game turned into Game 7 of the NBA Finals, the best in the league were up to their usual tricks.</p>
<p>As part of the opening ceremonies at the United Center, <a href="/nba/story/_/id/28719072/all-star-game-remembers-kobe-bryant-tributes-magic-jennifer-hudson-common" target="_blank">Hall of Famer Magic Johnson led a tribute</a> to the late Kobe Bryant and former commissioner David Stern, two legends of the sport lost this season.</p>
<p>From crucial blocked shots to rare alley-oops, this year's NBA All-Star Game was an <a href="/nba/story/_/id/28719614/this-nba-all-star-game-showed-power-basketball" target="_blank">homage to great basketball</a>.</p>
<p>See <a href="/nba/story/_/id/28694101/nba-all-star-2020-grading-every-player-team-lebron-team-giannis" target="_blank">how captains LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo</a> and the 22 other stars who hit the court fared in Chicago.</p>
<p>Saturday ushered in the second night of All-Star competition as players took the court to compete in the skills challenge, 3-point contest and dunk competition. Dwayne Wade and Candace Parker kicked off the night with a tribute to Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna.</p>
<p>The action that followed saw all three competitions come down to the wire, including a dunk-off between <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3936099/derrick-jones-jr">Derrick Jones Jr</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064290/aaron-gordon">Aaron Gordon</a>. Jones was one of two <a href="/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat">Miami Heat</a> players to win on Saturday, along with teammate <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066261/bam-adebayo">Bam Adebayo</a>, who won the skills competition. Kings center <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2990984/buddy-hield">Buddy Hield</a> won the other event of the night, narrowly edging <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136193/devin-booker">Devin Booker</a> in the 3-point showdown.</p>
<p>And though he was forced to withdraw from All-Star competition with <a href="/nba/story/_/id/28690405/damian-lillard-says-all-star-weekend-suffering-right-groin-strain-trail-blazers-loss" target="_blank">an injury</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6606/damian-lillard">Damian Lillard</a> made an appearance on stage.</p>

<p>The first-round matchups featured no wins by guards: Adebayo over <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2580782/spencer-dinwiddie">Spencer Dinwiddie</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3149673/pascal-siakam">Pascal Siakam</a> over <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3964/patrick-beverley">Patrick Beverley</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6609/khris-middleton">Khris Middleton</a> over <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278073/shai-gilgeous-alexander">Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</a>, and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3155942/domantas-sabonis">Domantas Sabonis</a> over <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4065648/jayson-tatum">Jayson Tatum</a>.</p>
<p>In round two, Adebayo defeated Siakam and Sabonis edged Middleton, setting up a final between the first-time All-Star power forwards from the Eastern Conference.</p>
<p>Despite making only one 3-pointer this season, Adebayo defeated Sabonis to become the first Heat player to win the Skills Challenge since Dwyane Wade in 2007.</p>
<p>The 3-point contest featured All-Stars <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4277905/trae-young">Trae Young</a> and Booker, as well as last year's champion <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2528794/joe-harris">Joe Harris</a>. Shooting guards <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3133601/devonte'-graham">Devonte' Graham</a>, Hield, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3157465/duncan-robinson">Duncan Robinson</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064440/zach-lavine">Zach LaVine</a> also participated, along with power forward <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6426/davis-bertans">Davis Bertans</a>.</p>
<p>Booker and Hield scored 27 points in the opening round, followed by Bertans' score of 26; those three advanced to the championship round. LaVine led all shooters that did not advance with 23 points, with Young bringing up the rear with 15 points.</p>
<p>Booker eliminated Bertans in the championship round by scoring 26 points, four more than the Washington big man. But Hield made his last money ball to edge Booker and become the first Kings player to win the 3-point contest since <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/813/peja-stojakovic">Peja Stojakovic</a> in 2003.</p>
<p>This year's dunkers included a high-rising multi-sport athlete in <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2578239/pat-connaughton">Pat Connaughton</a>, "Airplane Mode" Jones, 2016 runner-up Gordon and 2008 winner <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2384/dwight-howard">Dwight Howard</a>. The five judges: Former Finals MVP Dwyane Wade, two-time WNBA MVP Candace Parker, "Black Panther" star Chadwick Boseman, "I Used to Love H.E.R." rapper Common and Hall of Famer <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/663/scottie-pippen">Scottie Pippen</a>.</p>
<p>Howard was eliminated despite his return to Superman on a lob from former teammate Jameer Nelson, while Connaughton didn't advance despite jumping over MLB MVP Christian Yelich and NBA MVP <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3032977/giannis-antetokounmpo">Giannis Antetokounmpo</a>. Jones hit a reverse tornado through the legs for a "50" dunk, while Gordon compiled two 50s in the first round, the second coming after flying over Chance the Rapper.</p>
<p>Jones and Gordon scored two 50s each in the second round, forcing a final dunk-off to decide the contest. They each tallied another 50, then with their second dunk-off attempts, Jones windmilled from just inside the free throw line to score a 48, while Gordon leaped over Boston's 7-foot-5 center <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3904625/tacko-fall">Tacko Fall</a>. But Gordon only earned a 47, giving Jones a <a href="/nba/story/_/id/28712491/aaron-gordon-somehow-does-not-win-dunk-contest" target="_blank">controversial win</a>.</p>
<p><!--<br />
The <strong>skills contest</strong> is designed to showcase a little bit of everything -- quick dribbling through obstacles, throwing bounce passes and chest passes through cylinders, an end-to-end run for a layup and back the other way for a pull-up 3. It's a head-to-head tournament format, and the fastest time advances. There's always the fine line to walk of trying hard without looking like you're trying too hard, which is why <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3964/patrick-beverley">Patrick Beverley</a> is a popular pick -- he's going full speed.</p><p>But keep an eye on the sneaky, skilled bigs who want to show up their ballhandling brethren. Which is why <a href="/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat">Miami Heat</a> star <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066261/bam-adebayo">Bam Adebayo</a> might be the low-key favorite.</p><p>The <strong>3-point contest</strong> is <a href="/nba/story/_/id/28636195/nba-adds-pair-deep-shots-all-star-game-3-point-contest" target="_blank">getting a small tweak</a> to it for the eight-player field. There are the standard four racks with four regular balls plus one money ball that is worth two points. Then there's the all-money rack, where each ball counts for two, placed at the shooter's desired location.</p><p>But the new twist is an additional two balls -- colored green -- that will be 6 feet behind the line and worth three points apiece. There are two rounds, with the three highest scores moving on to the finals, where highest total wins.</p><p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2528794/joe-harris">Joe Harris</a> is the defending champ, but <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6426/davis-bertans">Davis Bertans</a> might be the pick. Not only is the Wizards sharpshooter completely lights out, but he's one of the best long-range shooters in the NBA, playing right into the revamped rules.</p><aside class="inline inline-photo full"><figure><picture ><source data-srcset="https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2020%2F0216%2Fr666855_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=570&format=jpg, https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2020%2F0216%2Fr666855_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=1140&cquality=40&format=jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2020%2F0216%2Fr666855_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=375, https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2020%2F0216%2Fr666855_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=750&cquality=40&format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"><img  class=" lazyload lazyload" data-image-container=".inline-photo" ></picture><figcaption class="photoCaption"><cite>Stacy Revere/Getty Images</cite></figcaption></figure></aside><p>There are no changes to the <strong>dunk contest</strong> this year, but we do get a blast from the past.</p><p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064290/aaron-gordon">Aaron Gordon</a> is an easy pick because he helped produce one of the <a href="/video/clip/_/id/14774947" target="_blank">most memorable duels of all time</a> alongside <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064440/zach-lavine">Zach LaVine</a> in 2016. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3936099/derrick-jones-jr">Derrick Jones Jr.</a> can get up too, and has previous dunk contest experience.</p><p>And Superman returns!</p><p>The nostalgia factor alone makes <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2384/dwight-howard">Dwight Howard</a> a popular pick to win, but how much bounce remains in those 34-year-old legs remains a question.</p><p>Keep an eye on dark horse <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2578239/pat-connaughton">Pat Connaughton</a>, though. <a href="https://theundefeated.com/features/bucks-pat-connaughton-this-white-boy-got-bounce-on-disproving-stereotypes" target="_blank">He didn't make it by accident</a>.

After an appetizer of <a href="https://twitter.com/NBAAllStar/status/1225159874431991808" target="_blank">All-Star celebrity game action</a> (7 p.m. ET, ESPN), 20 of the top NBA rookies and sophomores will go head-to-head in the Rising Stars game, with the teams divided into USA and World squads for the sixth consecutive year.</p><p>For the league's first- and second-year players who didn't make the cut, it's far from the end of the world, as budding stars such as <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3149673/pascal-siakam">Pascal Siakam</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2991230/fred-vanvleet">Fred VanVleet</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3934719/og-anunoby">OG Anunoby</a> were all once snubbed from the event.</p><p>Among the players who <em>will</em> take the floor, there is a handful of interesting matchups, led by the <a href="/nba/team/_/name/dal/dallas-mavericks">Dallas Mavericks</a>' <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3945274/luka-doncic">Luka Doncic</a> vs. the <a href="/nba/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-hawks">Atlanta Hawks</a>' <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4277905/trae-young">Trae Young</a>. Now, the 6-foot-2 Young is unlikely to actually defend 6-foot-8, 240-pound Doncic, but the two will always be linked given the draft-day trade that changed the course of their franchises. No one would be surprised to see the two young stars trading 30-footers down the stretch Friday night.</p><p>The best head-to-head matchup to watch? It might be Young against <a href="/nba/team/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder">Oklahoma City Thunder</a> guard <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278073/shai-gilgeous-alexander">Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</a>, who has made a strong case as the third-best guard to come out of the 2018 NBA draft.</p><p>I'm also interested to see how No. 3 overall pick <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395625/rj-barrett">RJ Barrett</a> looks, as I would consider him a dark horse MVP candidate in this one. With Doncic recently coming off an injury and also playing in Sunday's All-Star Game, I wouldn't expect him to be his typical high-usage self, which opens the door for the Duke lefty. Barrett is as aggressive as they come, and I'd imagine he'll treat this as an opportunity to remind the world that he's far better than the player people have seen in Madison Square Garden trying to create on a clogged court this season.</p><p><em>-- Mike Schmitz</em></p><p><img height="11" src="https://a.espncdn.com/redesign/assets/img/logos/espnplus/espnplus-2x.png"> <strong><a href="/nba/insider/story/_/id/28689831/drafting-2020-nba-rising-stars-based-future-star-potential" target="_blank">The best NBA rookies and sophomores to build around</a></strong></p><p>--></p>

<p><!--<b><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png" width="100%"></b></p><h2><b>All-Star Game FAQs</b></h2><p><b><strong>What is the new All-Star Game format?</strong></b></p><p>This year's All-Star Game will be all about <a href="/nba/story/_/id/28570251/lakers-legend-kobe-bryant-remembrances-reaction" target="_blank">honoring Kobe Bryant</a>.</p><p>In a <a href="/nba/story/_/id/28600471/nba-changes-all-star-game-format-adds-kobe-bryant-tribute" target="_blank">major change to the All-Star format</a>, the NBA announced it will turn every quarter into a mini-game for charity before an untimed final quarter with a target score that will decide which team wins. Scores will be reset -- back to 0-0 -- at the start of the second and third quarters, then restored to begin the fourth quarter.</p><p>That's where the tribute to Bryant and the No. 24 jersey he wore for the final decade of his NBA career comes into play. The team that wins the All-Star Game will be the first to reach a target score, determined by the total points the team in the lead scored in the first three quarters combined -- plus 24, the obvious nod to Bryant.</p><p><b><strong>How does the All-Star voting process work?</strong></b></p><p>Beginning in 2016-17, current players and media joined the fans in the voting process. Fans account for 50% of the vote to determine the starters, while players and media account for 25% each. Once votes are tallied, players are ranked in each conference by position (guard and frontcourt) within each of the three voting groups.</p><p>Each player's score is calculated by averaging his weighted rank from the fans, players and media. The two guards and three frontcourt players with the best score in each conference are named starters. Fan votes serve as the tiebreaker for players in a position group with the same score.</p><p>The seven reserves from each conference are selected by NBA head coaches. If there needs to be an injury replacement, that pick is determined by NBA commissioner Adam Silver.</p><aside class="espnDaily espnDaily--inline hidden"><div class="email-form"><div class="espnDaily__logo"></div><div class="espnDaily__title">Get the best of ESPN sent to your inbox <span>The ESPN Daily delivers the biggest sports news and moments every weekday.</span></div><input type="text" placeholder="Email Address"><button class="button-alt med" type="submit">Sign me up!</button><div class="espnDaily__links"><a href="https://disneyprivacycenter.com/">Privacy Policy</a><a href="http://www.espn.com/espn/daily">Read the Latest</a></div></div><div class="email-confirm hidden"><div class="espnDaily__logo espnDaily__logo--sent"></div><div class="espnDaily__title title"></div><div class="espnDaily__user-email">Email: <span class="user-email"></span></div></div></aside><p><strong>How are captains and teams selected? </strong></p><p>Instead of the traditional East vs. West format, the NBA moved to a new format in 2018, where two captains pick the teams from a pool of 24 players who are voted in by fans, media and players.</p><p>The captains are the All-Star starters who earn the most fan votes in their respective conferences. Alternating picks, the captains draft the eight remaining players from the starter pool in the first round and then all 14 players from the reserve pool in the second round, making selections without regard to a player's conference affiliation or position.</p><p>--></p>
