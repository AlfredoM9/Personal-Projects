Over the last two months, Sexton has played at a top-60 level, producing per-game stats of 23.8 points, 3.9 assists, 2.3 triples and 1.0 steals, while shooting 49.0 percent from the field, and 86.4 percent from the line in that span prior to this gem. Both Darius Garland (groin) and Kevin Porter (concussion) have been sidelined over the last few games, giving Sexton some extra on-court opportunity, seeing his usage rate jump from 26.7 on the season to 32.0 over his previous three outings.</p></p>

The second-year guard has been on a nice offensive heater of late, pouring in 25 or more points in five of his last six outings while shooting 54 percent from the field and 45 percent from 3-point range. As per usual, Sexton's numbers in the non-scoring categories have been somewhat lacking, so he'll continue to offer better fantasy utility in points leagues than rotisserie formats.</p></p>
