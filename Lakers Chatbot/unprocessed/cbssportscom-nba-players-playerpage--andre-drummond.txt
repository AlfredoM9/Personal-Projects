<p>Drummond is nursing a strained left calf and will miss at least Wednesday's game against Philadelphia as a result. In his absence, the <span data-canon="Cleveland Cavaliers" data-id="337" data-league-abbreviation="NBA" data-shortcode="annotation" data-team-abbreviation="CLE" data-text="Cavaliers" data-type="SPORTS_OBJECT_TEAM">Cavaliers</span> will likely lean more heavily on a combination of Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson and Larry Nance. Drummond's next chance to play will come Friday in New Orleans.</p>
