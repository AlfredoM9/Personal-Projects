<p><p>In a recent interview with 247Sports, <span data-canon="John Wall" data-id="1755192" data-league-abbreviation="NBA" data-shortcode="annotation" data-team-abbreviation="WAS" data-text="Wall" data-type="SPORTS_OBJECT_PLAYER">Wall</span> (Achilles) expressed confidence in his game as he continues to work back from a ruptured Achilles tendon.</p><p>Wall hasn't played in an NBA game since December of 2018, but he's gradually worked his way back toward full strength and is confident that he'll be able to return to playing at an All-Star level. "The sky is the limit," Wall said. "This is the healthiest I will have been, damn near my whole NBA career. That's why I took my time, that's why I didn't want to come back this season and be on a minutes restriction and try to do all of that. I just wanted to make sure I'm fully healthy, my body is where I want it to be and prepare for next season." Prior to the suspension of the NBA season, Wall had been practicing with the <span data-canon="Washington Wizards" data-id="361" data-league-abbreviation="NBA" data-shortcode="annotation" data-team-abbreviation="WAS" data-text="Wizards" data-type="SPORTS_OBJECT_TEAM">Wizards</span>' G League affiliate and going through 5-on-5 scrimmages without restriction. Wall also noted that he's spent time improving his jumpshot, which has been an on-and-off issue since he entered the league in 2010-11. Wall implied that the injury -- as well as bone spurs in his ankle -- contributed to his at times inconsistent shooting. "People don't even know that sometimes when going full speed and then trying to stop was the worst, it was like somebody stabbed me with a knife in my heel and twisting it," Wall said. "It was so bad but like me just being able to take time off and get fully healthy. When I shoot one-dribble pull-ups and run and do certain things, it doesn't bother me at all; I just feel free."</p></p>

Wall had been scrimmaging with the Capital City Go-Go roughly every three days prior to the shutdown, playing 20-to-25 minutes per scrimmage. "You want a highly competitive deal, so we sort of decided with John, it was time to play with the Go-Go (and) practice," Wizards GM Tommy Sheppard said. "And when we can, we'd have a scrimmage for him. It's just been wonderful. It validates our process we have in place, to be able to utilize the Go-Go for so many functions to help the Wizards. And for them, I think those kids were freakin' thrilled to play with John." By all accounts, Wall was beginning to look like his old self in practices, with G League teammates praising his athleticism and competitiveness. "You always wonder (when) someone comes off an injury like that, how they (are going to) come back," Go-Go point guard Jerian Grant said. "He's been scrimmaging with us, and he's coast to coast in two seconds. So he looks really good. ... Still playing the way he was playing before the injuries." According to Go-Go coach Ryan Richman, Wall appeared to be in good physical shape. "He looks slim. He looks really good," Richman said. "If we didn't take him out, he'd just go the whole time."</p></p>
