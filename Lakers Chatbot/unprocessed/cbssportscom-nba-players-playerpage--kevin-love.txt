The game ended in a blowout, though Love was able to record another double-double prior to garbage time. There are still murmurings that Love may be moved prior to the Feb. 6 deadline, but until then, fantasy managers can expect performances like this whenever he suits up. Though he's currently healthy, Love has played both ends of a back-to-back set just one time in five instances this season, so it wouldn't be surprising if Cleveland chose to rest him Tuesday against the Clippers. The Cavaliers conclude their road trip with another back-to-back set this weekend (Friday in Memphis, Saturday in Chicago).</p></p>
