Team USA Basketball at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics - Latest news, rosters, qualifiers
<p>Steph Curry tells Rachel Nichols he is looking forward to the experience of playing for Team USA at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. (0:47)</p>
<p>Team USA enters the Olympics in Tokyo as the three-time defending gold medal winner, but is coming off a disappointing seventh-place finish at the 2019 FIBA World Cup, the worst finish ever in a major international competition by a team from the United States.</p>
<p>Despite finishing seventh in China, Team USA has already qualified for the Olympics, which <a href="/olympics/story/_/id/28946033/tokyo-olympics-officially-postponed-2021">have been postponed </a>due to the coronavirus pandemic. Team USA earned its spot by virtue of being one of the top two finishers from the Americas region at the World Cup. Six other teams qualified based on their World Cup finish, joining the U.S. and host nation Japan in the field for Tokyo. The final four spots in the field had been set to be determined by four separate six-team qualifying tournaments to be held in June 2020. However, with the coronavirus outbreak and subsequent postponment of the Olympics, the status of those qualifying tournaments is still to be determined.</p>
