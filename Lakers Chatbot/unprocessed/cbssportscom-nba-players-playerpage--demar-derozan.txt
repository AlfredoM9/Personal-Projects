<p>As expected, DeRozan will miss a second straight game while dealing with back spasms. With nine days off starting Wednesday because of the All-Star break, the veteran forward will presumably be ready to go when the <span data-canon="San Antonio Spurs" data-id="356" data-league-abbreviation="NBA" data-shortcode="annotation" data-team-abbreviation="SA" data-text="Spurs" data-type="SPORTS_OBJECT_TEAM">Spurs</span> take on the Jazz to begin the second half of the regular season Feb. 21.</p>
