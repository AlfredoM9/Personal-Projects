Pistons Star Derrick Rose Reveals the Secret Behind His Special Layup Package - EssentiallySports
<p>In 2008, the Chicago Bulls drafted <a data-wpel-link="internal" href="https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/derrick-rose/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Derrick Rose</a>, one of the most athletic and explosive guards to ever play in the league. Right from the start of his career, he was adept at finishing at the rim. Whether it was a layup over bigger defenders or a powerful jam, Rose was an expert.</p>
<p>While appearing on the <a data-wpel-link="external" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-liberation-of-derrick-rose/id1496870253?i=1000496443542" rel="noopener noreferrer external" target="_blank">Pushin’ Thru podcast</a>, former NBA champion BJ Armstrong asked him about his layup game.</p>
<p><em>“Growing up, I used to always play with older guys,”</em> Rose replied. <em>“Whenever I used to get on the court, I used to have to play through fouls because of my. There was no such thing as a foul. So you had to play through contact. I used to always find ways to get the ball up because I was smaller.</em></p>
<p><em>“The layup package came from me having to find ways to be creative and witty. It converted into the NBA because, in the NBA, the length of the guys now is crazy.”</em></p>

<p>Pre-injury Rose can be considered among the best finishers the league has ever seen. He blitzed past defenders with this electric pace, and even if they caught up, his driving was so good, he would either get a foul, complete the layup, and sometimes both. Despite being 6’2, he was fearless to finish strong.</p>

<p>But this is how Rose ended up getting injured. He tore his ACL during a playoff game against the 76ers in 2012 while trying to drive to the rim. Since then, he has never been able to replicate his MVP form.</p>
<p>For the first time since 2017, Rose has now played back-to-back seasons with at least <a data-wpel-link="external" href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/rosede01.html" rel="noopener noreferrer external" target="_blank">50 games</a>. After a splendid season with the Timberwolves, he signed a two-year deal with the Pistons. He averaged 18 points per game, coming off the bench, and finished <a data-wpel-link="external" href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2020.html" rel="noopener noreferrer external" target="_blank">seventh</a> in the Sixth Man of the Year voting.</p>
<p>Despite the league moving towards outside shooting, Rose #1 weapon in the 2019-20 season was his layups. <a data-wpel-link="external" href="https://www.nba.com/stats/player/201565/shooting/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season" rel="noopener noreferrer external" target="_blank">40%</a> of his total 753 field goal attempts came from driving to the rim, and he could convert a whopping 60%. He may not be as aggressive as before, but he still has the talent. Fans will hope that he can play for a contender soon and have a shot at the title before retiring.</p>
