<p><p>Nance finished with 16 points (6-6 FG, 2-2 3Pt, 2-4 FT), six assists, four rebounds, two steals and one block in 32 minutes during Tuesday's loss to the Bulls.</p><p>Tristan Thompson was out in this one after being poked in the eye in their last game, clearing the way for Nance to see a little extra run. He's played well lately, putting up per-game stats of 11.7 points, 8.0 boards, 3.4 assists, 1.7 steals and 1.1 triples, while shooting 49.3 percent from the field over the last two weeks of play. Those numbers are good for a spot inside the top 70 of nine-category leagues.

<p><p>Nance provided 19 points (7-13 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and 10 rebounds in 43 minutes Sunday in the <span data-canon="Cleveland Cavaliers" data-id="337" data-league-abbreviation="NBA" data-shortcode="annotation" data-team-abbreviation="CLE" data-text="Cavaliers" data-type="SPORTS_OBJECT_TEAM">Cavaliers</span>' 132-129 win over the Spurs.</p><p>The Cavaliers welcomed back one key piece of their frontcourt back from injury in Andre Drummond (calf), but Tristan Thompson's (eye) first-half exit coupled with the extra period opened up plenty of run for Nance as the team's third big man. Nance's path to a consistent 25-minute role may be more of a challenge if Drummond, Thompson and Kevin Love are all available for the Cavs' next game Tuesday in Chicago, but the 27-year-old still looks worthy of holding until his role begins to stabilize a bit. Nance may be helped if the Cavs are willing to deploy him more frequently at small forward -- something that new coach J.B. Bickerstaff has seemingly been more receptive to than former bench boss John Beilein was.</p></p>

Nance's minutes were pushed up in part because of the overtime period, but coach J.B. Bickerstaff also gave him some run at small forward to prop up his playing time. Don't expect Nance to see much action behind Cedi Osman and Kevin Porter at that position moving forward, but if the 27-year-old can find a path to around 25 minutes per game, he'll retain utility in 12-team leagues.</p></p>
