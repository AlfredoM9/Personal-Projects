<p>Buddy Hield is unhappy with the <a href="https://www.nbaanalysis.net/category/sacramento-kings/">Sacramento Kings</a> and could be in a new uniform next season. Everyone in New York would not be sad to see that uniform be a blue and orange <a href="https://www.nbaanalysis.net/category/new-york-knicks/">Knicks’</a> jersey.</p>
<p>Hield signed a massive extension with the Kings, but was passed over for Bogdan Bogdanovic. Hield’s role on the bench did not make the former Oklahoma Sooner happy. </p>
<p>If there is a team in need of a three-point threat, or just any threat in general, it is the Knicks.</p>
<p>New York was among the worst shooting teams in the league this past season. Over the last two years, Hield is averaging 20.6 points per game while shooting 40.8% from the three-point line. Those two numbers right there make the deal worth it for the Knicks, but there is more. </p>
<p>Hield is a capable ball handler and would give the Knicks a scoring option down the stretch of games.</p>
<p>It seems more likely with each day that Buddy Hield is going to be sent somewhere. Here are three packages that could send him from the Kings to the Knicks.</p>

<p>It’s the offseason, so that means one thing — unrealistic trade and free agent rumors surrounding the New York Knicks. It has already started with the idea of the Knicks making a blockbuster deal for <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="https://www.nbaanalysis.net/2020/10/23/5-trades-the-new-york-knicks-should-look-to-make-this-offseason/" title="5 trades the New York Knicks should look to make this offseason">[…]</a></p>
<p>The Sacramento Kings face a strange relationship with Buddy Hield entering the offseason and pursuing a trade being what appears to be the best option. The Philadelphia 76ers, on the other hand, need to move <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="https://www.nbaanalysis.net/2020/09/17/b-r-suggests-kings-76ers-trade-centered-around-buddy-hield/" title="B/R suggests Kings-76ers trade centered around Buddy Hield">[…]</a></p>
