Dwyane Wade makes a bold claim about NBA draft prospect Anthony Edwards - Heat Nation
<p><a href="https://heatnation.com/tag/dwyane-wade/" title="Dwyane Wade">Dwyane Wade</a> made a bold prediction about the player he believes deserves to be selected No. 1 overall in next month‚Äôs 2020 NBA Draft.</p>
<p>Wade recently commented on social media that Anthony Edwards of the University of Georgia should be taken as the first pick of the 2020 NBA Draft because of how good he can be. The <a href="https://heatnation.com/tag/miami-heat/" title="Miami Heat">Miami Heat</a> legend went as far as to say that Edwards could be better than him.</p>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">He can be better. America here is your number 1 pick! Ayo <a href="https://twitter.com/VicOladipo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@VicOladipo</a> we‚Äôre all built from the same cloth üí™üèæ That Tom Crean cloth! <a href="https://t.co/ZTXg9VpZU7">https://t.co/ZTXg9VpZU7</a></p>

<p>Though Edwards initially suggested that he can be better than one of the best shooting guards of all time, Wade did not see it as arrogance from the University of Georgia product.</p>
<p>Instead, the 13-time All-Star complimented the youngster who is expected to be one of this year‚Äôs top three picks. Playing just one season of college basketball, Edwards averaged 19.1 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.8 assists per contest.</p>
<p>If Edwards expects to be better than Wade, then he has a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>Aside from the All-Star appearances, Wade was also a member of the 2003-04 All-Rookie First Team, made an All-NBA team eight times, an All-Defensive team three times and was an NBA champion three times.</p>
<p>The 6-foot-4 guard also owns a scoring title, an All-Star MVP and a Finals MVP. A future Hall of Famer, Wade has amassed an impressive resume that will be tough for Edwards to top.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Wade seems confident that Edwards can surpass all of his accomplishments.</p>
<p>The NBA draft will be held on Nov. 18.</p>

Prior to the Internet, he devoured every reading material he could find on the game from newspaper articles to books and magazines. He became a Heat fan the moment they acquired Tim Hardaway and his killer crossover, and lamented not seeing him and Alonzo Mourning win a championship. Seeing Dwyane Wade, LeBron James and Chris Bosh play in Miami was a surreal moment for him and more so after they validated the Decision with back-to-back championships. He is ecstatic to cover Miami basketball for Heat Nation.</p>
