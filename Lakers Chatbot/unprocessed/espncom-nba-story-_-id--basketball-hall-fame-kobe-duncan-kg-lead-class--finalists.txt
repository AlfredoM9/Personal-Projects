Basketball Hall of Fame - Kobe, Duncan, KG lead Class of 2020
<p>Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett and Tamika Catchings are among the members of the 2020 Basketball Hall of Fame class. (1:38)</p>
<p>Recognizing that the Class of 2020 could be one of the most star-studded ever, the Basketball Hall of Fame streamlined the induction process for this year. The selection committee cut the number of finalists from the North American and Women's committees in half, and is passing on inducting new members for its direct-elect committees with the exception of the International Committee, instead putting the focus on a group that includes <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/215/tim-duncan">Tim Duncan</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/261/kevin-garnett">Kevin Garnett</a> and the late <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/110/kobe-bryant">Kobe Bryant</a>.</p>
<p>The full Class of 2020 was unveiled on April 4. The nine new members of the Basketball Hall of Fame will be enshrined in Springfield at a ceremony in 2021, after the original ceremony was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
