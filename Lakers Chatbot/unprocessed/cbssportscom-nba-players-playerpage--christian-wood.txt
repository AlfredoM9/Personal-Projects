He's up to eight double-doubles through 53 appearances this season, this after managing two through his first 51 career contests. Wood has benefitted most from Andre Drummond's departure, and the 24-year-old big man should be scooped up immediately if he's still sitting on any waiver wires.</p>

The potential return of Markieff Morris (illness) could hurt Wood a bit, but Wood will at least remain worth holding in 12-team leagues until his playing time and production actually dips.</p></p>
