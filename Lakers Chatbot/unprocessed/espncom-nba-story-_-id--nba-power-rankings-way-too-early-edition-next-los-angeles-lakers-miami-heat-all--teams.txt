NBA Power Rankings, way-too-early edition - Next for Los Angeles Lakers, Miami Heat and all 30 teams
<p>Tim Legler declares LeBron James and Anthony Davis the most versatile duo in NBA history, and he chooses the Lakers as title favorites for next season. (1:35)</p>
<p>The <a href="/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a> are the 2020 NBA champions, <a href="/nba/story/_/id/29647539/nba-finals-2020-schedules-news-odds-latest-updates-miami-heat-vs-los-angeles-lakers">blitzing through the bubble playoffs</a> with a 16-5 record and finishing off the <a href="/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat">Miami Heat</a> in <a href="/nba/game?gameId=401248438">six games in the NBA Finals</a>.</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
<p>As the league enters an offseason of more uncertainty, we're taking a way-too-early look at where all 30 teams stand heading into the 2020-21 season.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> These rankings are based on which teams voters (a group of more than 40 reporters, insiders and editors) think belong higher heading into next season, taking into account potential player movement and the draft.

Now GM Rob Pelinka will look to maintain a championship-contending roster around James. First priority is Davis, who can opt out and get a raise. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6461/markieff-morris">Markieff Morris</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3201/jared-dudley">Jared Dudley</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2384/dwight-howard">Dwight Howard</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6628/dion-waiters">Dion Waiters</a> are free agents. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2581018/kentavious-caldwell-pope">Kentavious Caldwell-Pope</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4240/avery-bradley">Avery Bradley</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3452/javale-mcgee">JaVale McGee</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3026/rajon-rondo">Rajon Rondo</a> all have player options for 2020-21. Pelinka has the $9.3 million midlevel and $3.6 million biannual exceptions to use. The rest of the West will only get better, but the Lakers will defend their title with the best superstar tandem, a second year with head coach Frank Vogel and hopefully no bubble to contend with next season. <em>-- Ohm Youngmisuk</em></p>

2021 title odds: +400</p>
<p>After watching the Clippers' collapse to the Nuggets, owner Steve Ballmer decided not to risk another disappointing finish. Doc Rivers, fired in late September, <a href="/nba/story/_/id/30018563/sources-doc-rivers-agrees-deal-coach-philadelphia-76ers">took over in Philly</a> and was <a href="/nba/story/_/id/30121649/sources-ty-lue-finalizing-five-year-deal-coach-la-clippers">replaced by Ty Lue</a>. While the front office will explore the trade market, the Clippers probably will find it difficult to significantly upgrade the roster. They'll look to re-sign free agents <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2991055/montrezl-harrell">Montrezl Harrell</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6462/marcus-morris-sr">Marcus Morris Sr</a>. and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2327577/jamychal-green">JaMychal Green</a>. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2799/lou-williams">Lou Williams</a> has an expiring contract, but the Clippers don't have any first-round picks to dangle. The coaching staff will have to get the best out of this championship-caliber roster, which needs a playmaking point guard and leader.<em> -- Youngmisuk</em></p>

<p>After the Bucks finished with the best record in the regular season for the second straight season but failed to reach the Finals, the biggest question is what's next for <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3032977/giannis-antetokounmpo">Giannis Antetokounmpo</a>. The reigning MVP and Defensive Player of the Year has a big decision to make -- and so do the Bucks, as they're expected to offer him a supermax extension.

<p>After making history by authoring two comebacks from 3-1 series deficits on their way to the conference finals, the Nuggets' next step is to win the West. They have playoff experience and two bona fide stars in <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3112335/nikola-jokic">Nikola Jokic</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3936299/jamal-murray">Jamal Murray</a>, who might have taken more strides than any other budding star in the bubble. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278104/michael-porter-jr">Michael Porter Jr</a>. seems poised to be a third star next season. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2991070/jerami-grant">Jerami Grant</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2488653/mason-plumlee">Mason Plumlee</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3015/paul-millsap">Paul Millsap</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2528693/torrey-craig">Torrey Craig</a> are free agents, with Grant a major priority. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6579/will-barton">Will Barton</a>'s health remains a question, and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2999547/gary-harris">Gary Harris</a> has to improve this offseason, but it's good to be the Nuggets right now.<em> -- Youngmisuk</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3945274/luka-doncic">Luka Doncic</a>'s emergence as an MVP candidate gives the Mavericks legitimate hopes of being a championship contender earlier than anticipated, although they need co-star <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3102531/kristaps-porzingis">Kristaps Porzingis</a> to stay healthy. All signs indicate that the Mavs won't make a major offseason splash until 2021, when Dallas can create a max slot for a free agent with a little salary-cap tinkering. Expect the Mavs, however, to hunt for some veteran toughness. It's clear that an upgraded defense (ranked 18th this season) is needed to complement Dallas' historically efficient offense.<em> -- Tim MacMahon</em></p>

<p>Boston reached the Eastern Conference finals for the third time in four years but failed to make it back to the NBA Finals after losing to the <a href="/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat">Miami Heat</a> in six games. While most of the team is under contract for next season, the biggest uncertainty is whether <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4249/gordon-hayward">Gordon Hayward</a> will opt in to his $34.1 million player option for 2020-21. There isn't an obvious landing spot for him if he does, but the Heat didn't look like a landing spot for Jimmy Butler a year ago, either. Otherwise, Boston enters the offseason with three first-round picks with which to work. <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6479/kemba-walker">Kemba Walker</a>'s health will be a priority after he dealt with knee issues for all of this calendar year, as will the growth of their two franchise wing players, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4065648/jayson-tatum">Jayson Tatum</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3917376/jaylen-brown">Jaylen Brown</a>.<em> -- Tim Bontemps</em></p>

<p>After replacing Brett Brown with Doc Rivers, the 76ers hope to finally make the deep playoff run that has eluded them with <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3059318/joel-embiid">Joel Embiid</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3907387/ben-simmons">Ben Simmons</a>. General manager Elton Brand has a big decision to make this offseason after fit issues plagued the Sixers this season. Specifically, can he find a taker for <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3213/al-horford">Al Horford</a>, who didn't fit next to Embiid like Philadelphia had hoped he would? When Embiid was not on the court, Horford proved he can still play center. Another big question the Sixers will have to answer: Will Simmons remain a full-time power forward? And, if so, who will be the team's starting point guard next season, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3915195/shake-milton">Shake Milton</a> or someone who isn't on the roster yet?<em> -- Bontemps</em></p>

2019-20 record: 44-29<br/>

2021 title odds: +1400</p>
<p>The biggest question surrounding the Heat is whether they can duplicate the success they had in the bubble in a normal basketball world. Miami's future appears to be very bright with <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6430/jimmy-butler">Jimmy Butler</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066261/bam-adebayo">Bam Adebayo</a> leading a young core, but will they be able to persuade another star to join them in South Beach?

<p>If the Nets were a trendy Brooklyn restaurant, 2019-20 was the aperitif and 2020-21 looks like the main course. Having missed all of this season following his Achilles rupture in the 2019 NBA Finals, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant">Kevin Durant</a> should be ready to go for training camp. So should the other players, including <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6442/kyrie-irving">Kyrie Irving</a>, who sat out the Nets' playoff sweep at the hands of Toronto. Brooklyn does have to re-sign starting wing <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2528794/joe-harris">Joe Harris</a> and consider possible trades to better complement Durant and Irving, but the sky is the limit for a talented group under rookie coach Steve Nash.<em> -- Kevin Pelton</em></p>

2021 title odds: +2000</p>
<p>The Raptors' focus remains on 2021, when they're expected to be one of many teams in pursuit of Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo. In the meantime, the Raptors have three key players -- guard <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2991230/fred-vanvleet">Fred VanVleet</a> and big men <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3439/serge-ibaka">Serge Ibaka</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3206/marc-gasol">Marc Gasol</a> -- who will be unrestricted free agents. VanVleet is one of the best players on the market and could be in for a big payday this offseason. Ibaka and Gasol could both return on one-year deals, though there is a possibility that Gasol <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/marc-gasol-rumored-considering-return-220005063.html">returns to his native Spain to finish out his career</a>. Then there is the status of team president Masai Ujiri, who has one year left on his contract.

As far as the roster goes, there isn't much flexibility given their expensive rotation. One big question: Will indispensable 35-year-old small-ball center <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3033/pj-tucker">P.J.

<p>Utah's front office never wavered on its long-term plan to build around <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3908809/donovan-mitchell">Donovan Mitchell</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3032976/rudy-gobert">Rudy Gobert</a>, despite <a href="/nba/story/_/id/29406398/utah-jazz-stars-donovan-mitchell-rudy-gobert-rift-them">friction in their relationship</a> that was exacerbated by their COVID-19 diagnoses. That confidence was justified by the chemistry and professionalism the duo displayed in the bubble. It's an easy decision to sign Mitchell to a max extension as he enters the final season of his rookie deal. Extension discussions with Gobert, who is eligible for the supermax, probably will be much more complicated. Limited in ways to upgrade the cast around their franchise cornerstones, the Jazz can't afford to miss with their midlevel exception.<em> -- MacMahon</em></p>

<p>This was something of a transition year for the Blazers. They dealt with key departures from a group that went to the Western Conference finals, as well as a rash of injuries that put them in a hole to climb out of just to make the playoffs. Their bubble run was rousing but ultimately capped a disappointing season. Continuity has been the hallmark of the Blazers, who've retained the same GM, the same coach and the same star. The roster is largely under contract (<a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4262/hassan-whiteside">Hassan Whiteside</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1975/carmelo-anthony">Carmelo Anthony</a> are the big offseason questions), but the Blazers will need to make changes if they're to rise back to the upper tier of the West.<em> -- Royce Young</em></p>

<p>The Thunder were one of the league's surprise success stories last season, given the expectation was that the roster was going to be sold off for parts to the highest bidder as the franchise began an inevitable rebuild. And with virtually the entire roster back next season -- except <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3428/danilo-gallinari">Danilo Gallinari</a>, who is an unrestricted free agent -- the Thunder will enter the 2020-21 season in pretty much the same situation.

<p>We're nearing two full years since <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4237/john-wall">John Wall</a>'s last NBA game in December 2018. Wall returns to a Wizards team that was competent without him offensively but had the league's worst defensive rating when the season stopped. Although Washington is looking to develop young talent, such as 2019 lottery pick <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066648/rui-hachimura">Rui Hachimura</a>, the Wizards will also aim to contend with Wall and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6580/bradley-beal">Bradley Beal</a> together in the backcourt. That means re-signing free agent <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6426/davis-bertans">Davis Bertans</a> and adding a defense-minded center. If that doesn't work, Washington will have to consider trading Beal ahead of his possible 2022 free agency.<em> -- Pelton</em></p>

<p>For the first time since 1997, the Spurs watched the playoffs from home. Of course, their fortunes changed in the 1997-98 season as they drafted Hall of Famer Tim Duncan. It's unlikely the Spurs will get that sort of talent this year with the No. 11 pick. The Spurs had some success playing small with <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3978/demar-derozan">DeMar DeRozan</a>, who is expected to opt in to his $27.7 million player option, at power forward in the bubble with <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2983/lamarcus-aldridge">LaMarcus Aldridge</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136196/trey-lyles">Trey Lyles</a> out.

<p>Sacramento disappointed in the bubble while failing to make the playoffs for the 14th straight season. And now Joe Dumars and Monte McNair are helping owner Vivek Ranadive make decisions with Vlade Divac gone. The Kings' new regime has four picks in the draft, including the 12th pick, but it will have to figure out what to do with restricted free agent <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3037789/bogdan-bogdanovic">Bogdan Bogdanovic</a> and a potential extension for <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066259/de'aaron-fox">De'Aaron Fox</a>. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2990984/buddy-hield">Buddy Hield</a>, who didn't seem thrilled with his sixth man role last season, enters next season with a big contract extension.

The NBA's fourth-worst point differential (minus-6.8 per game), however, shows how much room there is for improvement. That started with lottery luck, as Charlotte landed the No. 3 pick.

<p>Motown fans were disappointed after another lackluster season during which the Pistons finished 20-46. The Pistons kicked off the offseason by bringing in new general manager Troy Weaver, who is widely respected for his ability to evaluate talent dating to his 12 seasons in Oklahoma City. Veterans <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3989/blake-griffin">Blake Griffin</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3456/derrick-rose">Derrick Rose</a> were key pieces on last season's roster, but injuries continued to plague them. Weaver will have a lot of work on his hands to restore the organization. Working in his favor is massive cap space in addition to the No. 7 overall pick in the NBA draft.<em> -- Woodyard</em></p>

<p>Another season, another new direction for the Knicks. Having hired super-agent Leon Rose as team president in March, New York brought in Tom Thibodeau as head coach. Now New York needs to build a better-fitting roster than the one that finished 21-45 last season.
