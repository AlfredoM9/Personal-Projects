The <span data-canon="Indiana Pacers" data-id="343" data-league-abbreviation="NBA" data-shortcode="annotation" data-team-abbreviation="IND" data-text="Pacers" data-type="SPORTS_OBJECT_TEAM">Pacers</span> will play it safe with their star guard, who is still working his way back to full strength from a torn quad tendon. Monday's game comes on the first day of a back-to-back set, so the hope is that Oladipo is back in the lineup Tuesday versus Orlando.</p>
<p><p><span data-canon="Victor Oladipo" data-id="2067694" data-league-abbreviation="NBA" data-shortcode="annotation" data-team-abbreviation="IND" data-text="Oladipo" data-type="SPORTS_OBJECT_PLAYER">Oladipo</span> (knee) is listed as doubtful for Monday's game against the Wizards.</p><p>Per Scott Agness of VigilantSports.com, coach Nate McMillan said after Sunday's walk-through practice that Oladipo would sit out one half of the <span data-canon="Indiana Pacers" data-id="343" data-league-abbreviation="NBA" data-shortcode="annotation" data-team-abbreviation="IND" data-text="Pacers" data-type="SPORTS_OBJECT_TEAM">Pacers</span>' upcoming back-to-back set, so his doubtful designation implies that Monday's contest will likely be his time to rest. Oladipo played near a full minutes load (32) in Saturday's win over the Sixers, finishing with 15 points (6-14 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 1-2 FT), seven rebounds, two assists and one steal. If he does in fact end up sitting Monday, Aaron Holiday would be the top candidate to start at shooting guard, though there could be room for both him and Edmond Sumner on the top-unit backcourt if Malcolm Brodgon (neck) is also out.</p></p>
