Descrp: This program is an implementation of a very simple and naive chatbot. This chatbot has a domain knowledge around
        the Los Angeles Lakers and can only speak regarding that subject. At times, the chatbot answers perfectly at
        other times not so much. This program uses a lot of techniques discussed in class from tokenization, POS
        tagging, term count, tfidf, and machine learning. The chatbot works like  this. It introduces itself and gets
        the information of the user. The user information is stored and then allows the user the freedom to type
        anything. The program uses rule based and ML to determine if it is a question, if so it tries to answer it by
        doing cosine similarity between the query and the knowledge base. It returns the most common sentence. If the
        input is not a question, then it determines if it is a command using rule based, if so it tries to do that
        command by treating it as a question. Otherwise, it performs sentiment analysis using ML to determine if its an
        opinion that is negative or positive of the user. It then stores it with the connotation and replies to it. The
        process then repeats until the user enters a command that makes it exit.

        Note: You might have to have some things downloaded first to get this program to work.
              For example, nltk.download('twitter_samples') must have been prior to running this program.
              If any error occurs, please feel free to contact me or download the necessary files.

5) Who did the lakers play against in the 2020 nba finals?
6) How many championships do the lakers have?
7) What is the longest streak of the lakers?
8) How did the lakers get Wilt Chamberlain?
9) What are the colors of the lakers?
10) What does showtime mean for the lakers?
