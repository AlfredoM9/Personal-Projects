Though Edwards initially suggested that he can be better than one of the best shooting guards of all time, Wade did not see it as arrogance from the University of Georgia product.
Instead, the 13-time All-Star complimented the youngster who is expected to be one of this year‚Äôs top three picks.
Playing just one season of college basketball, Edwards averaged 19.1 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.8 assists per contest.
If Edwards expects to be better than Wade, then he has a lot of work to do.
Aside from the All-Star appearances, Wade was also a member of the 2003-04 All-Rookie First Team, made an All-NBA team eight times, an All-Defensive team three times and was an NBA champion three times.
The 6-foot-4 guard also owns a scoring title, an All-Star MVP and a Finals MVP.
A future Hall of Famer, Wade has amassed an impressive resume that will be tough for Edwards to top.
Nonetheless, Wade seems confident that Edwards can surpass all of his accomplishments.
The NBA draft will be held on Nov. 18.
