Word of Kobe Bryant's death in a helicopter crash on Sunday morning shook the NBA world to its core.
As many struggled to process and comprehend the tragedy, the NBA's slate of Sunday games carried on as scheduled
Multiple afternoon games tipped off shortly following the news.
The Rockets and Nuggets were the first to tip off in Denver, with an extended moment of silence being held in memory of Bryant.
Players in that game could be seen grieving with one another before and during the game.
The Spurs and Raptors got underway later, and those two teams found a unique way to honor Bryant's memory.
As the game started, both squads dribbled out the shot clock and voluntarily took back-to-back 24-second violations as a nod to Kobe's No.
