Kobe in the giving mood on Tuesday - TrueHoop- ESPN
The Los Angeles Lakers earned their first overtime win of the season in large part to Kobe Bryant who finished with 32 points and 11 assists.
Bryant joins Deron Williams and Russell Westbrook as the only players this season with multiple games with at least 30 points and 10 assists.
Bryant
This was Bryant’s fourth 10-assist game of the season and in doing so he recorded his 5,005th career assist.
He becomes the third player in Lakers history to eclipse the 5,000 assist mark with the team, joining Magic Johnson and Jerry West.
Bryant also became the seventh player in NBA history to register 25,000 points, 5,000 rebounds and 5,000 assists.
Bryant’s teammates didn’t do too bad Tuesday night either as Lamar Odom finished with 20 points and a season-high 20 rebounds.
It was Odom's second career 20-20 game.
Pau Gasol added 26 points and pulled down 16 rebounds.
The Elias Sports Bureau tells us that it had been exactly 38 years since two Lakers had at least 20 points and 16 rebounds in a game.
On February 1, 1973, Wilt Chamberlain had 25/19 (points/rebounds) and Bill Bridges went 20/16 in a win at the Phoenix Suns.
The most interesting note of the day came from the Lakers opposition, the Houston Rockets.
Guard Kevin Martin, who leads the NBA in free throws made, was 10-11 from the free throw line.
He attempted AND made every single free throw for the Rockets.
The last player to attempt all his team's free throws in a single game (min.
10 attempts) was Steve Francis on April 8, 2002 at the Orlando Magic (went 7-11).
The last player to make all his team's free throws in a single game (min.
10 attempts) was Bill Cartwright on November 13, 1979 vs the Washington Bullets.
Cartwright was 11-11 while the New York Knicks as a whole went 11-13.
Elsewhere around the league, two hoopers notched career highs of their own.
LaMarcus Aldridge scored a career-high 40 points and grabbed 11 rebounds.
According to the Elias Sports Bureau, only two other Portland Trail Blazers starting forwards ever had 40/10 (points/rebounds) in a game.
Maurice Lucas went 46/17 at the Boston Celtics in January 1979, and Zach Randolph had two such games in 2007: 42/12 in January and 43/17 in March, both against the Memphis Grizzlies.
Jason Smith, making his first NBA start at center, shot 9-11 (81.8 percent) while playing just 25:12 in the New Orleans Hornets win over the Washington Wizards.
Only one other starting center in Hornets' history has ever shot 80 percent or better in a game while attempting at least 10 field goals and playing fewer than 26 minutes.
Kenny Gattison was 10-12 (83.3 percent) in 20 minutes in a Hornets' 141-134 loss at the Cleveland Cavaliers on April 9, 1992.
