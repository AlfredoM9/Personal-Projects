Kobe Bryant requests no more gifts, ceremonies during farewell tour - Los Angeles Lakers Blog- ESPN
ATLANTA -- Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant has requested that opposing teams do not present him with gifts or hold any on-court ceremonies during his final season in the NBA, a Lakers spokesman confirmed Friday.
Bleacher Report first reported the news.
Bryant announced Sunday in a poem on The Players' Tribune that he would be retiring at the end of the season, his 20th in the NBA.
He had been adamant before his announcement that he didn't want a "farewell tour" of sorts or all the hoopla that comes with it.
However, in his first game after the announcement, in his hometown of Philadelphia against the 76ers on Tuesday, Bryant was presented with a framed jersey from Lower Merion, the nearby high school where he starred two decades ago.
Sixers legend Julius Erving and Bryant's high school coach Gregg Downer presented Bryant with the jersey.
Bryant was also recognized with a video tribute during Tuesday's game against the Washington Wizards, and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that the Atlanta Hawks planned to do the same in Friday's game at Phillips Arena.
