Kobe Bryant youngest to hit 20,000 points | CBC Sports
Los Angeles Lakers superstarKobe BryantSundaybecame the youngest NBA player to reach 20,000 points.
Bryant scored 39 points as he guided the Lakers to a 95-90 win against the lowly New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden.
Bryant also added 11 rebounds and eight assists during his return to the Garden in almost two years.
The Lakers guard reached the milestone after a three-pointer in the opening minutes of the third quarter, reaching the mark at 29 years, 122 days.
"I always like playing here, period," Bryant said.
"Last year I didn't have an opportunity to play and I was upset about it.
This is my favourite arena to play in, so I'm just happy and relieved that I was able to play tonight."
Bryant, who was suspended last year before the Lakers traveled to the Garden, surpassed legends Wilt Chamberlain (29 years, 134 days) and Michael Jordan (29 years, 326 days).
