Little Capri is shown swaddled in pink as she sleeps with a floral headband over her dark tresses.
Weeks earlier, the proud parents announced the June 20 birth with a photo that appeared to be a quilt that featured the baby’s name.

In January, the retired basketball star, 40, rung in the new year with a special announcement — featuring a gold, sparkling graphic — on Instagram.
“NEW YEAR, NEW BABY!
BABY MAMBA ON THE WAY 2019,” he wrote then.
“Vanessa and I are beyond excited to announce that we are expecting another #mambacita to go along with Natalia, Gianna, and Bianka.”

Meanwhile, Vanessa, 37, wrote that “Bianka will have a new baby sibling to play with and Natalia and Gianna are super excited to welcome another little baby sister to love.”
Bryant told Extra in 2017 that Vanessa was hoping to add a boy to the Bryant brood.
And despite teasing from his friends and teammates about being the only male in his home, Bryant says he wouldn’t have it any other way.
“My friends say, ‘It takes a real man to make a boy,’ ” Bryant said.
“I’m like, ‘Dude, it takes a king to make a princess … get in line!’ “
