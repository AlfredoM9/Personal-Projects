Jay Chou releases MV with Kobe Bryant | Pop Asia | Asia Music News and Updates

As previously reported, Jay Chou collaborated with Kobe Bryant, not only in a Sprite commercial, but also on a single, “天地一鬥” (roughly “Battle Between Heaven and Earth.”) The proceeds for downloads of the single online and for ringtones are all being donated to impoverished schools for basketball facilities and equipment.
Besides the single, Jay Chou decided to self-direct the MV for the song.
He, also, took on the responsibility of choreography by himself.
In order to try creating a fusion of Eastern and Western choreography into the MV, it took him two entire weeks to complete it.
The final product was quite to Kobe’s liking also earning Jay much praise.
