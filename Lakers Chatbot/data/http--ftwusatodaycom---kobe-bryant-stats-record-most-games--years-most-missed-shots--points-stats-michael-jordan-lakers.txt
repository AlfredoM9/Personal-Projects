40 stats you won’t believe about Kobe Bryant’s historic NBA career | For The Win
1.
Kobe Bryant’s 81 points from his historic Jan. 22, 2006 game against the Raptors are 10 more than anyone else of his era.
(Davis Robinson had 71 in 1994 on the final day of the season to snatch a scoring title away from Shaquille O’Neal.)
Michael Jordan’s 69 (and various other performances by MJ) is the only other modern player within 18 points of Kobe’s 81, which is second all time behind, of course, Wilt Chamberlain’s 100 points.
Wilt also holds the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th and 10th highest-scoring games.
2.
Bryant’s 81 points in a game in which the Lakers scored 122 is the highest percentage a single player had of his team’s output (66%) and the highest percentage of points one player has ever scored in a a game for both teams (36%) in NBA history.
3.
Fourteen games before dropping 81, Kobe scored 62 points against the Mavs.
It was the most points he’d scored in a game up until that point and is currently third on his all-time list.
4.
Lest you think Kobe was just throwing up shots willy-nilly, his .609 shooting percentage that night was his third-highest of the season.
5.
His 81 points also raised his scoring average 1.1 points over that single game, which is absurd when you consider than it came just short of halfway through the season.
6.
Kobe has played the 19th most games in NBA history (1,293) but has the third most points (ahead of Michael Jordan).
However, that stat won’t be as impressive after Kobe retires because, barring injury, he should move up to No.
11 by the end of the season.

7.
No one else in NBA/ABA history has played three decades (20 years) with the same team.
8.
No other guard has played 20 years either.
9.
Kobe will finish his career with the third-most free throws in NBA history and the fifth-most attempts.
However, he’s only No.
84 with his .837 average, which barely puts him above Bill Laimbeer.
10.
The famous ball-hog is actually No.
124 career in assists per game (4.77).
Because I know you were wondering, MJ is No.
91 with 5.11.

11.
On basketball-reference.com, Kobe is listed as having four nicknames, some of which we all know, others I’m not so sure about: Black Mamba, KB24, Vino.
12.
Vino is a horrible nickname and, frankly, KB24 isn’t far behind.
Black Mamba though?
That’s some A+ stuff.
13.
Career single-season highs for Kobe: Games — 82 (in 2002-2003, 2007-08, 2008-2009 and 2010-2011).
That means that in those three seasons alone, Kobe played 300 NBA games, including the playoffs.
And that’s not to mention his Team USA games up to and including the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
(It’ll be a crime if Kobe is left off the 2016 Olympic roster, by the way.
I’m sure one of the younger players with a gold already would be all too happy to give up his spot.)
Where were we.
Oh, right: single-season highs.

26.
A number of good-to-great NBA players were taken ahead of Bryant (more than usual), who went No.
13 in the 1996 NBA draft to the Charlotte Hornets before his quick trade to Los Angeles Lakers.
They included Allen Iverson (No.
1), Marcus Camby (No.
2), Shareef Abdur-Raheem,  Stephon Marbury (No.
4), Ray Allen (No.
5) and Antoine Walker (No.
6).
But there were still plenty of busts including Samaki Walker (No.
9),  Todd Fuller (No.
11) and Vitaly Potapenko (No.
12).
27.
Kobe won just one NBA MVP award, one less than Steve Nash and tied with Derrick Rose.
28.
He did, however, make 17 All-Star games (second behind Kareem) and have 11 first-team All-NBA selections (tied with Karl Malone for best ever).
(AP)
29.
Vino won four All-Star game MVPs, tied for most ever, which is about right.
30.
Kobe was also a nine-time NBA first-team all-defense selection, tying him for most ever with MJ, Kevin Garnett and Gary Payton.
(The award has only been around since the late-1960s though)
31.
Only two players have more playoff points than Kobe’s 5,640 — MJ and Kareem.
(AP)
32.
Quick, how many scoring championships does Kobe have?
(Waits for your guess.)
Would you believe it’s only two — won in back to back seasons of 2006 and 2007?
That’s one less than Bob McAdoo.
Two fewer than George Gervin, Allen Iverson and Kevin Duant and the same as Tracy McGrady and Adrian Dantley.
33.
Kobe had 134 40-point games in his career.
As of now, he’s gone for 40+ in 10.3% of his games.
34.
Bryant has the most missed shots in NBA history (about 14,000), which is more than 500 past his closest “competitor” and 1,500 more than his closest contemporary.
35.
Bryant led the NBA in missed shots six times.

36.
Kobe’s similarity score on basketball-reference is closest to John Stockton, who actually had more win shares than Kobe in every year except their rookie seasons.
37.
How polarizing is Kobe?
On basketball-reference, there is a fan index that measures a player’s popularity.
MJ, Bird, Hakeem, Stockton/Malone, Duncan, LeBron (!
), Garnett, Ewing, Chris Paula and Charles Barkley are all in the top 20.
Kobe is ranked No.
348, just behind Cuttino Mobley.
38.
In his career, Kobe won 17 player of the month awards, close to the equivalent of two full season.
He won 33 player of the week awards, basically the equivalent of one season.’
39.
In each of the five years Kobe’s Lakers won the title, he never led the team in win shares.
Shaq led the first three times and Pau Gasol led the final two.
40.
Kobe will have worn his No.
8 and his No.
24 for a decade each upon his retirement.

Designing jerseys is hard.
Everyone has an opinion.
And it's always cool to hate on things when they first come out.
With that being said, there are new NBA alternate jerseys that various teams across the league will allegedly wear for next season.
Not many of them have been made official just yet, so we don't know if some of these will actually be worn.
But fans are still coming with their takes — most of them are getting roasted.
Some are good, some are bad and some just look like joints you could buy from the vendor with the stand...
NBA agents were very much so in their feelings after Rich Paul hosted an Pro Day for Anthony Edwards and Tyrese Maxey as they prepare for the NBA draft.
Because it was broadcast on ESPN 2, they felt like Paul was giving his prospects "unwarranted attention" and that the NBA should've stopped it.
This was just the latest in a series of anonymous complaints about Rich Paul and Klutch.
LeBron James has had enough of those complaints.
He came to the defense of his agent and close friend in his Instagram story on Friday night.
He sent a message to those...
LeBron James won his fourth NBA Championship in 2020 to cap off the league's unprecedented bubble season, but amid nationwide protests following the shooting of Jacob Blake in August, James says that the Lakers were ready to call off the season to focus on fighting for reform.
The Milwaukee Bucks sparked a pause to the NBA playoffs after boycotting a game against the Orlando Magic, leading the NBA to delay games as players and officials discussed the next steps to take.
There were reports that the Clippers and Lakers wanted to end the season, but as James explained...
