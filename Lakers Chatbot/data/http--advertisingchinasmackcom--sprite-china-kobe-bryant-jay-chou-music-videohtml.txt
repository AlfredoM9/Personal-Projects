Sprite China: Kobe Bryant & Jay Chou Music Video – Advertising @chinaSMACK
Sprite China has paired up NBA Star Kobe Bryant of the LA Lakers and Taiwanese pop star Jay Chou (å¨æ°ä¼¦) for its 2011 Chinese marketing campaign.
The two celebrities feature in a basketball themed song called “The Heaven and Earth Challenge” or in Chinese å¤©å°ä¸é¬¥ (TiÄndÃ¬ yÄ« dÃ²u).
The ‘rough’ music video features Kobe and Jay duelling each other on the basketball court.
Sprite or as it is called in China éªç¢§ (XuÄbÃ¬) has managed to bring together two of Chinese youngsters favourite past-times: Singing (i.e.
KTV) and Basketball.
I have no doubt that this campaign will go down a storm in the Mainland.

The theme song can be downloaded as a ringtone from Sprite China’s website.
All proceeds received from the downloads will be donated to Project Hope (å¸æå·¥ç¨ – XÄ«wÃ ng gÅngchÃ©ng), a charity that as part of its goals, aims to improve the basketball facilities available in poor Chinese schools.
A 30 second TV commercial promoting Sprite has also been produced and is currently airing in Taiwan and the Chinese Mainland:

Below is also a video that shows some behind the scenes footage of the music video:
Kobe seemed rather surprised by Jay Chou’s B-Ball skills, I doubt the same could be said for Jay Chou’s views on Kobe’s singing.
Here is Kobe holding the new single.
For those who enjoyed the song and want to sing along, here are the lyrics:
Kobe Bryant: Do you know how to play B-ball, Jay Chou?
Jay Chou: Of Course!
