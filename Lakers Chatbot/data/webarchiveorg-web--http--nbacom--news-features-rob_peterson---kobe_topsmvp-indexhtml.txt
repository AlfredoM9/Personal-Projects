After having LeBron James and Kobe Bryant one-two in Race to the MVP for nearly two months, this week we've flipped the two.
Last season, before Bryant won his first MVP award, we didn't move Kobe to the top spot until he faced off against the Hornets' and Chris Paul in late April.
Until then, the authors of Race to the MVP had Paul at No.
1 for most of the season's second half, and rightfully so.
The Hornets had exceeded expectations by not only leading the Southwest Division, the NBA's toughest and but also challenging for the top seed in the rugged West.
But then, Kobe and the Lakers -- with the help of a Spanish import -- came on strong down the stretch and challenged the upstarts from the Crescent City for supremacy in the West.
On April 11, 2008, Kobe had 28 points, 10 boards and nine assists as the Lakers topped New Orleans 107-104 en route to staking their claim to the No.
1 seed in the conference.
We bring up last season for two reasons: one, to illustrate how close we thought the race was between Paul and Bryant, and two, the speed with which Kobe overtook Paul.
But like most memories, ours have been clouded by time.
We may have thought the race to be close, but when the votes were counted, it wasn't.
Kobe was first on 82 of the 126 first place votes, with Paul receiving 28 first-place votes.
That's a blowout.
Also, last year Kobe seemed to rocket into the No.
1 at the end.
This year, Kobe's ascension into the No.
1 spot has had the feel of the tortoise vs. the hare, with Kobe calmly plotting, playing consistently excellent basketball after a slow statistical start.
He subjugated his game to make his teammates better.
"Isn't that what an MVP is supposed to do?"
the e-mails said.
Yes, but LeBron had been making his teammates better as well as putting up incredible numbers.
That's why we've had him at the top most of the season.
That's why he may be No.
1 again next week.
It's that close.
And wouldn't that be something to talk about?
 You can e-mail us your thoughts at RacetotheMVP@gmail.com.
Hoops Line of the Week: LeBron James, Feb. 20: 55 points, five boards, nine assists vs. Milwaukee in a 111-103 win.
What, only five boards?
Slacker.
Rise of the week: Yao Ming (back into the top 10) Drop of the week: Pau Gasol (out of the top 10)

    Against the Magic, Wade scored 50 and the Heat lost.
Two nights later, Wade scored 31, but dished 16 assists and the Heat beat the Pistons (but then again, who hasn't?).
I'd say that's the key to getting a Miami win, but strangely the Heat are only 3-3 in games this season where Wade goes for 30-10.

Paul has been very steady in his past four games, notching up a double-double in points and assists in three of them.
The only game where he didn't was his 24-point, seven-assist game against his Draft classmate and on-court nemesis, Deron Williams.
Paul has averaged 15.7 points in 12 games against the Jazz, his worst numbers against any team except Philly (15.0 ppg in four games).

Did you know that Duncan is only one of two players named Duncan to play in the NBA?
Whenever I research Tim's stats, the other Duncan, Andy, a 6-foot-6 center -- center!
-- pops up in the search.
From 1948-51, he played two seasons for the old Rochester Royals and one with the Celtics.
He averaged 5.5 points per game for his career.
No I'm sure Andy was a fine man, but I think our Duncan is better.
And now Tim is shooting .700 from the free throw line.
Nice work, sir.

After he scored three measly points against the Celtics in Denver, I received an e-mail about how unworthy Billups was for a space on this list.
Two things about that: one, check out his 33-point game on Wednesday in a win against Atlanta; and two, look at the Pistons without him.

The trend continues: you need to go all the way back to mid-December to find a game where Roy played 40 or more minutes and the Blazers won.
Weird.
Also, you need to hope Roy's 5-for-18 from the field against San Antonio was an anomaly because the Jazz are closing in fast for second in the Northwest.
