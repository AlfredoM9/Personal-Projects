Kobe Bryant fans upset he wasn't included in 2020 MTV VMAs ‘in memoriam’ segment
Bryant died in January when his helicopter crashed in California
Kobe Bryant fans are upset that the basketball star wasn’t included in last night’s MTV VMAs ‘in memoriam’ segment.
A number of stars were honoured as part of the 2020 Video Music Awards, including Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman and Glee‘s Naya Rivera.
Blink-182‘s Travis Barker introduced the segment during the ceremony, which was held around New York City, socially distanced but without an audience.
Fans of Bryant, who died in January after his private helicopter crashed, were disappointed that the late L.A. Lakers star had been left out, especially due to the fact he had released music earlier in his career.
“Who at the #VMAs forgot to include Kobe Bryant in the In Memoriam section?!?
You added Naya and Chadwick, you weren’t sticking to just music,” one fan wrote.
Another said: “How DARE you guys Not pay tribute to KOBE BRYANT!!!!
He is an Academy Award winner and Legend!!!
And you choose to leave him out of your 2020 tribute!” They hashtagged the tweet #BoycottVMAs.

Lady Gaga was the MTV VMAs 2020’s biggest winner, taking home five awards on the night, including Artist Of The Year and the inaugural Tricon Award.
The star used her speeches to spread messages of hope and encouragement, telling viewers: “A renaissance is coming.”
BTS also took home four awards at the event, including Best Group, Best Pop, Best K-pop and Best Choreography for ‘On’.
The Korean group gave their debut live performance of their new single ‘Dynamite’, which was released last week (August 21).
The Weeknd, meanwhile, won two awards and used his speeches to call for justice for Jacob Blake and Breonna Taylor.
“It’s really hard for me to celebrate right now and enjoy this moment,” he said.
The world's defining voice in music and pop culture since 1952.
