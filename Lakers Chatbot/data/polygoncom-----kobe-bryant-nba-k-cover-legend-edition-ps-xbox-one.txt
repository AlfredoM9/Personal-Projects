Second cover appearance for the future hall-of-famer
Kobe Bryant, who today will play his last game after a two-decade career in the NBA, will star on the cover of a "legend edition" for NBA 2K17 when it launches this fall, 2K Sports announced this morning.
NBA 2K17's Legend Edition will feature "special Kobe-themed memorabilia and digital content extending his legacy for fans beyond his final NBA game tonight."
This version will cost $79.99; Amazon Prime members canÂ pre-order it for $63.99.
The "Legend Edition" is available only for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
Standard editions of NBA 2K17 will launch for those platforms as well as PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows PC in September, 2K Sports said.
A 15-time NBA All-Star, five-time NBA champion and a certain selection for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Bryant, 37, announced in November that this season would be his last of 20, all of them spent with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Bryant previously starred on the cover of NBA 2K10, an anniversary edition celebrating the 10th year of the acclaimed basketball simulation.
He also appeared with 2K Sports at Sony's E3 2011 news conference in the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena to showcase NBA 2K12.
"As I walk off the NBA court for the final time, it's exciting to know my fans can continue to celebrate my lifelong career as a Los Angeles Laker," Bryant said in a statement.
The Legend Edition will include three physical premiums: a poster, two trading cards, and a "Black Mamba" game controller skin.
Digital goodies include three Bryant-themed cosmetic items (including a No.
8 jersey he wore for the Lakers from 1996 to 2006), plus 30,000 Virtual Currency for use in the MyCareer suite, and three packs of MyTeam cards, one of which is guaranteed to be Bryant in a limited-use form.
The main edition cover star for NBA 2K17 will be unveiled this June.
