In this season of giving, Lakers coach Byron Scott wants to provide one important present to his star player, Kobe Bryant.
Said Scott: “Rest.” 
						
After having extensive conversations with Bryant about his recent fatigue and inefficient play, Scott sat Bryant for Tuesday’s game against the Golden State Warriors at Staples Center.
Bryant will rejoin the Lakers on Wednesday morning when they travel to Chicago, but his playing status remains unclear for the team’s Christmas Day game against the Bulls.
Scott also said he has not determined if Bryant will sit in Friday’s game against the Dallas Mavericks to conserve his energy on a back-to-back situation.
Scott also has not decided if he will reduce Bryant’s point guard responsibilities.

						}
					

“It might be something I have to do periodically along with trying to get the minutes down,” Scott said.
“Sometimes I’ll have to give him days off as well as games off.”  
Bryant has averaged 24.6 points per game this season on a career-low 37.2 percent shooting clip in 35.4 minutes.
But Bryant’s 8-of-30 shooting and nine turnovers in Sunday’s loss to Sacramento prompted Scott to consider sitting his star player.
Scott said he will trim Bryant’s minutes to 32, including sitting him at the end of the first and third quarters.
Scott also said he instructed Bryant to defer more to his teammates and that he will run fewer plays for Bryant.
Scott reported Bryant didn’t embrace the idea immediately, but changed his sentiments after Scott explained his thought process for five minutes.
“Then he was more like, ‘OK coach, whatever you want to do, I’m on board,’” Scott said.
“That’s something I really appreciated.”

Warriors coach Steve Kerr admired Bryant recently surpassing Michael Jordan for third place on the NBA’s all-time scoring list.
But Kerr wouldn’t rank Bryant favorably over Jordan, his former Chicago Bulls teammate.
“You know where my allegiances lie,” Kerr said, laughing.
“I had three rings thanks to Michael, so I’m always going to side with him.” 
Kerr found similarities in Bryant and Jordan in both their footwork and fadeaway jumpers.
But Kerr highlighted Jordan’s career field-goal percentage (49.7 percent) over Bryant’s (a career 45.2 percent shooter).
The comparisons go beyond their skill-sets.
Bryant went on a profanity-laced tirade during a portion of a recent practice that was open to the media.
How did that compare to Jordan’s?
“If Twitter had been around back then, that would have been a daily occurrence with Michael,” Kerr said.
“That looked very familiar to me.
Back then, we just had practice and nobody was there.
Nobody documented every second of it.
Everybody had different styles of leadership and Michael was honest all the time.
It worked.” 
But Kerr hardly seemed interested in revisiting the time he and Jordan exchanged punches during a practice.
“We’re not talking about that,” Kerr said, laughing.
“I’m so sick of that.”
