One of Kobe Bryant’s sisters has posted emotional online photos of her brother with family through the years.
Sharia Washington — whose Facebook profile picture is now just a circle of mourning black — uploaded 10 snapshots, including of her smiling NBA legend brother cradling some of his four daughters as babies and hugging her and their sister Shaya.
Other photos feature Bryant’s 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, who was killed along with her dad and seven others in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, Calif., on Sunday morning.
“My heart is so heavy, I wish I could take some of the hurt.
Please know you that you family is in consent prayers,” Tiffany Taylor Young responded to the post.
