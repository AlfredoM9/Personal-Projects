Kobe Bryant divorce: Couple will share custody of 2 daughters | L.A. NOW | Los Angeles Times
Kobe Bryant and Vanessa Bryant plan to share custody of their two children, according to divorce papers filed in Orange County court Friday.
In the document, Vanessa Bryant cited "irreconcilable differences" in seeking a divorce from the Lakers star.
The document also said the couple will share both physical and legal custody of their daughters, Natalia, 8, and Giana, 5.
While Vanessa Bryant filed the papers Friday stating her intentions to end her 10-year marriage to the Lakers star, the documents were signed earlier this month.
