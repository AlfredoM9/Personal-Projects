Kobe Bryant, who's currently busy getting standing ovations in every arena he plays in during his final season, will still bleed green when the Rams come to Los Angeles.

Bryant, a Philadelphia native, has been an Eagles fan his whole life.
And according to Lakers reporter Serena Winters, he has no intention of switching allegiances despite a team returning to the town he's spent his entire professional career playing in.
Kobe Bryant says he's "excited" for the NFL to come to LA, but "I'm always going to have my green helmet."
(Kobe's a Philly fan).
Both the Raiders and Rams left L.A. in 1994, which was two years before Bryant became a Laker.
Kobe hasn't wavered in his fandom, as he was supportive even after the team went 4-12 in 2012.
He said in 2013 he hoped Chip Kelly would figure out how to turn the team around (spoiler alert: he didn't).
Even better: he's dealt with bandwagon Cowboys fans his whole life and trash-talked Dallas supporters he's been teammates with.
What's Kobe doing after retirement?
Word on the street is Doug Pederson needs to hire a bunch of people.
