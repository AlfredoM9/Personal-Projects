A long nine months await Kobe Bryant as he sits out the remainder of the 2014-15 season.
The Lakers’ star will go through tedious amounts of rehabilitation after having a two-hour surgical procedure Wednesday to repair a torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder.
Exhaustive debate will ensue on whether the 36-year-old perennial all-star can both play at an elite level and stay healthy following his third season-ending injury in the past three years.
Yet, the Lakers remain confident Bryant will return for the 2015-16 campaign and play out the final year of his contract that will pay him $25 million.
“I expect Kobe to make a full recovery and, if all goes as expected, he should be ready for the start of the season,” Dr. Neal ElAttrache said in a statement.
Both ElAttrache and Dr. Steve Lombardo completed the surgery on Wednesday at the Kerlan Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic in Los Angeles.

The Lakers (13-34) already enter Thursday’s game against the Chicago Bulls (30-17) at Staples Center fielding adversity.
They have the NBA’s fourth-worst record, part of which included the team going 2-9 without Bryant.
The Lakers’ nine-game losing streak also brings them one defeat shy of tying the franchise record set in April, 1994 for most consecutive losses in a season.
“If that happens, I’m going to feel pretty messed up,” Lakers coach Byron Scott said.
“But right now, I’m trying to go through the process of trying to get us better, seeing some of our young guys and develop some of those guys.” 
Scott reported Bryant sounded in “great spirits” during a five-minute phone call Wednesday morning before surgery.
Scott also joked Bryant texted him and consoled him Tuesday evening following the Lakers’ loss against Washington.
But nothing matches the ominous cloud surrounding Bryant’s future.
Bryant plans to wear a sling to protect his right shoulder in the next six weeks.
But the rest of his rehabilitation after that currently remains unclear.
“All I know is that it’s pretty painful,” Scott said, “and the rehab is long.”

							googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display("div-gpt-ad-Cube_Article"); } );
						}
					

The Lakers’ timetable on Bryant’s recovery also means he could either return at some point during training camp in Hawaii or just before the 2015-16 season starts.
“In my mind, he’s coming back next year,” Scott said, “unless he tells me something different.” 
Bryant tore his left Achilles tendon on April 2013 and returned eight months later.
But Bryant played only six games in the 2013-14 season before fracturing his left knee.
In his 19th NBA season, Bryant averaged 22.3 points albeit on a career-low 37.3-percent shooting through 35 games before aggravating his right shoulder last week in New Orleans.
Bryant then sat out the past three games while making various doctor visits before determining he would have surgery.
Bryant became the fourth Lakers’ player to have a season-ending injury, including veteran guard Steve Nash (back), rookie forward Julius Randle (right knee) and reserve swingman Xavier Henry (left Achilles).
“The biggest thing with Kobe is as long as (the media) are saying that he’s done, he’s going to come back,” Scott said.
“He proved this year that he has a lot left in the tank and is still one of the best players in this league.
If you guys keep saying he’s done, that’ll help him as well.” 
Scott may believe Bryant has a lot left in his tank.
But Scott sounded cognizant Bryant will have to play with far more efficiency than a gas-guzzling vehicle.
Scott originally pledged to play Bryant between 30 to 40 minutes per game during the 2014-15 season.
But after Bryant averaged 35.4 minutes per game in the Lakers’ first 27 contests, Scott scaled back Bryant’s workload in hopes to improve his energy and shooting accuracy.
Bryant sat in eight of the next 16 contests and missed most practices and shootarounds before injuring his shoulder.
“For Kobe, play him at mid to low 20s minute-wise, but you have to have some horses to be able to do that,” said Scott, before looking ahead to free agency in July.
“A lot of it depends on what guys we bring in.” 
The Lakers will have about $24 million to spend, roughly enough to offer a maximum-salary contract to one play.
The Lakers also only have Bryant, Randle, Nick Young and Ryan Kelly under guaranteed contracts, leaving the Lakers with as many as 11 roster spots to fill.
Hence, why Scott considered Bryant’s health “super important” in attracting potential stars.
Scott added that Bryant will “absolutely” play in active part in recruiting free agents.
But first things first.
Bryant’s nine-month rehab begins.

The Lakers’ timetable on Bryant’s recovery also means he could either return at some point during training camp in Hawaii or just before the 2015-16 season starts.
“In my mind, he’s coming back next year,” Scott said, “unless he tells me something different.” 
Bryant tore his left Achilles tendon on April 2013 and returned eight months later.
But Bryant played only six games in the 2013-14 season before fracturing his left knee.
In his 19th NBA season, Bryant averaged 22.3 points albeit on a career-low 37.3-percent shooting through 35 games before aggravating his right shoulder last week in New Orleans.
Bryant then sat out the past three games while making various doctor visits before determining he would have surgery.
Bryant became the fourth Lakers’ player to have a season-ending injury, including veteran guard Steve Nash (back), rookie forward Julius Randle (right knee) and reserve swingman Xavier Henry (left Achilles).
“The biggest thing with Kobe is as long as (the media) are saying that he’s done, he’s going to come back,” Scott said.
“He proved this year that he has a lot left in the tank and is still one of the best players in this league.
If you guys keep saying he’s done, that’ll help him as well.” 
Scott may believe Bryant has a lot left in his tank.
But Scott sounded cognizant Bryant will have to play with far more efficiency than a gas-guzzling vehicle.
Scott originally pledged to play Bryant between 30 to 40 minutes per game during the 2014-15 season.
But after Bryant averaged 35.4 minutes per game in the Lakers’ first 27 contests, Scott scaled back Bryant’s workload in hopes to improve his energy and shooting accuracy.
Bryant sat in eight of the next 16 contests and missed most practices and shootarounds before injuring his shoulder.
“For Kobe, play him at mid to low 20s minute-wise, but you have to have some horses to be able to do that,” said Scott, before looking ahead to free agency in July.
“A lot of it depends on what guys we bring in.” 
The Lakers will have about $24 million to spend, roughly enough to offer a maximum-salary contract to one play.
The Lakers also only have Bryant, Randle, Nick Young and Ryan Kelly under guaranteed contracts, leaving the Lakers with as many as 11 roster spots to fill.
Hence, why Scott considered Bryant’s health “super important” in attracting potential stars.
Scott added that Bryant will “absolutely” play in active part in recruiting free agents.
But first things first.
Bryant’s nine-month rehab begins.
