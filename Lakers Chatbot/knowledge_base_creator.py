# Descrp: This program will create a web crawler that starts from a google search and tries to crawl through the web
#         to find more relevant urls. This cycle is repeated until a url limit is reached. From the urls the program
#         will scrape the relevant text off the page, unprocessed, and write it to a txt file. These files will be
#         placed under the unprocessed folder. Then the program will get the data from these unprocessed files and
#         try to process the data to extract only the sentences. These sentences will then be written back to a file
#         under a processed folder having one sentence for each line. The program will then try to find the most
#         important terms using two methods. First it will use the tf-idf to get the most important words of each
#         document. Then the program will do some calculation based on the document size to determine how many
#         top-weighted words of each document to extract and add to the overall list of important words. From these
#         important words, a table will be created for each word. The entries of the table will be sentences from any
#         document containing that term. This would be the knowledge based. The knowledge base will be a database file
#         having a table for each important term and storing all the sentences from the corpus that contains that
#         term.
