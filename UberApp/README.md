# Description
Created a Java mobile app that used Android Studio, GeoFire API, Google Maps API, and Firebase to successfully have a Uber-like application. I used Google Authentication to sign up and log in users and drivers. The users were allowed to request for rides which I used GeoFire API to acquire the coordinates of the locations being requested and Google Maps API to be able to use Google Maps within my application. The requests were saved in the database along with its coordinates. On the driver side the driver could accept the request and see the location of the user. The driver’s location was then periodically updated and saved to the database. Both the users and driver are able to see each other’s location. The user then gets a notification when the driver arrives, and the user is able to cancel a ride at any time.
