# Description 
Created a series of three games in Unreal Engine using C++. The first game is a character that needs to pick up objects before its health drains down. If that occurs the player dies and respawns. The movement and entirely of the game were done solely in C++. The next game is breakthrough in which the ball moves and breaks bricks. Again, the entirely of the game was done solely in C++. Finally, the last game is Pac-Man. This game has the basic functionalities (enemies, respawning, teleporting on the edge of the map) of the original game and the project was done using C++ (70%) and the blueprints of Unreal Engine.
